== Near future

* test with full-stacked Rails, test with i18n-inflector-rails
* remove unneeded files

== Distant future

* add "any token" operator - will make it easier to create complex patterns - (use negative matching to non-existant, reserved value)
* split interpolate_core and make it more reusable by raw data (e.g. pattern content)
* allow different descriptions for aliases pointing to the same token, e.g.: now: @present ="description"
