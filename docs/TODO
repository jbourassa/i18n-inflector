== Near future

* add some simple cache that counts hits and removes lowest in case of fulfillment

* add a switch that causes inflection arguments to be gathered and removed before using original
  version of translate and then injected when interpolating happens (default value
  for that switch should be true if there is I18n version 4 installed)

  - not so good idea to turn it on by default since the same variable may be used to interpolate
    inflections and variables

* attach translation data name to raised errors

* allow different descriptions for aliases pointing to the same token, e.g.: now: @present ="description"

== Distant future

* scoped kinds (e.g: person.singular, person.plural) and fallbacks (tokens and kinds inheritance)

* add some external iterators for tokens, aliases, kinds, true_tokens
