== Near future

* add missing raises to documentation (interpolation, loading)
* ban reserved keys while processing kinds (including :default)
* update documentation
* add validation checks to interpolation (options, tokens in options) and to API (arguments)

* allow different descriptions for aliases pointing to the same token, e.g.: now: @present ="description"

== Distant future

* scoped kinds (e.g: person.singular, person.plural) and fallbacks (tokens and kinds inheritance) - do we need it at all?
