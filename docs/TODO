== Near future

* validations for wildcard tokens and for excluded defaults
  (where the token is taken from options) - make some testing method

== Distant future

* split interpolate_core and make it more reusable by raw data (e.g. pattern content)
* allow different descriptions for aliases pointing to the same token, e.g.: now: @present ="description"
