== Near future

* check if lazy evaluation of inflection methods is done once for multiple patterns
* place docs/USAGE links in a better place [done]
* use temporary hash for joining results of inflected languages

== Distant future

* split interpolate_core and make it more reusable by raw data (e.g. pattern content)
* allow different descriptions for aliases pointing to the same token, e.g.: now: @present ="description"
