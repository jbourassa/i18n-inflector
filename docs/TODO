* named patterns: @gender{m:xx|f:xxx|n:xzc} - such pattern may allow multiple tokens but it breaks the logic unless some marker will be given in configuration like !gender: that would inform engine that exact kind must be present in a pattern

* use commas in patterns to separate tokens that should have to the same value

* use negation symbols (!) in patterns to mark tokens that should generate value if are not matched (processing ends on first negative match)

* use tilde symbols (~) to allow multiple negative matches. the values will be joined as they are interpolated (with other negative matches or a positive, it just means that the processing won't stop on some particular token)
