* add some magic to API calls when kind has strict marker in front of it
* update documentation for InflectionDataStrict[done] and InflecitonData[done]
* update documentation for API[done] and API_Named[done]
* write some examples in section Accesing Information
* write some examples in section Named Patterns

== Near future

* add a switch that causes inflection arguments to be gathered before using original
  version of translate and then injected when interpolating happens (default value
  for that switch should be true if there is I18n version 4 installed)
