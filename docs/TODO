== Near future

* document multiple patterns
* document inflection keys (key-based inflection) - add note about ordered hashes
* add some examples about complex and multiple patterns

* inflected keys - the whole key is treated as a pattern:

  @welcome:
    f:  Dear Lady
    m:  Dear Sir
    n:  Dear You
    @free:  Dear All
    @kind: gender
    
 in translate() jump to method from Interpolate that will transform that into pattern

* check & fix: bad locale or locale not inflected and commented pattern..

== Distant future

* split interpolate_core and make it more reusable by raw data (e.g. pattern content)

* allow different descriptions for aliases pointing to the same token, e.g.: now: @present ="description"
