== Near future

* allow different descriptions for aliases pointing to the same token, e.g.: now: @present ="description"

== Distant future

* scoped kinds (e.g: person.singular, person.plural) and fallbacks (tokens and kinds inheritance)

* add some external iterators for tokens, aliases, kinds, true_tokens
