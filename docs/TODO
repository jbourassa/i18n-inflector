== Near future

Inflector jako pochodna InflectionStore?

* update documentation for InflectionDataStrict and InflecitonStore
* add duplication tests for named patterns, and other tests
* add some negative tests (e.g. empty kind, kinds as nils or empty striongs, tokens as empty strings...)

== Distant future

* use tilde symbols (~) to allow multiple negative matches. the values will be joined as they are interpolated (with other negative matches or a positive; it just means that the processing won't stop on some particular token) â€“ is this good idea anyway?
