== Near future

* add validation checks to interpolation (options[done], tokens in options[done]) and to API (arguments)
* backward compatible constants
* add missing raises to documentation (interpolation, loading[done])
* update documentation (long_comments)

* update error descriptions and names in long_comments [done]
* move complexpatternmalformed to the errors that are raised when flag is present [done]
* test complex pattern content without a proper strict kind in front [done]
* allow :default as gender name (that will trigger default value if any) - write test for it [done]
* review options documentation and add inflector_ [done]
* ban reserved keys while processing kinds (including :default) [done]
* ban all :inflector_ named keys [done]
* check if all errors are really in use [done]
* fixit: when a default token in present then I18n::InflectionOptionNotFound is not raised [done]


== Distant future

* allow different descriptions for aliases pointing to the same token, e.g.: now: @present ="description"

* split interpolate_core and make it more reusable for raw data

* sytactic sugar: @kind{something}{something_for_that_kind_too}

* inflected keys - the whole key is treated as a pattern:

  @welcome:
    f:  Dear Lady
    m:  Dear Sir
    n:  Dear You
    @free:  Dear All
    @kinds: gender

* scoped kinds (e.g: person.singular, person.plural) and fallbacks (tokens and kinds inheritance) - do we need it at all?
