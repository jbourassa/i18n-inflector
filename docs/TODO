== Near future

* document loud tokens

* add a switch that causes inflection arguments to be gathered and removed before using original
  version of translate and then injected when interpolating happens (default value
  for that switch should be true if there is I18n version 4 installed)

  - not so good idea to turn it on by default since the same variable may be used to interpolate
    inflections and for direct interpolation

* attach inflection key name to some raised errors

* add some external iterators for tokens, aliases, kinds, true_tokens

* allow different descriptions for aliases pointing to the same token, e.g.: now: @present ="description"

== Distant future

* Combined patterns (!!!!!!!!!!!!)

  - @person+time{i+now:am|i+past:was}
  - @person+time{i+now:am|i+past:was|he,she,it+now:is}
  - @g_sender+g_receiver{...} - for Hebrew for example

* case-insensitivity switch for inflection options (?)

* think about allowing negative matches to be AND-ed, e.g.: !m&!f:impersonal (?)
  - that will double positive-matching syntax, and make it even less KISS
