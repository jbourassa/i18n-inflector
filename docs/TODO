== Near future

* finish is_* methods with kind testing [done]
* replace internal aliases with tokens with marker [done]
* move error messages out of InflectionData and do the tests on higher level
* add method is_kind? and kind_exists? [done]
* change @inflection_ to one hash [done]
* add error for reporting bad arguments in API calls [done]
* interpolation: use one hash to store both positive- and negative- matching tokens
* allow aliases in patterns (switched) [aliases loading and replacement during initial read]
* rewrite docs for switching methods

* use tilde symbols (~) to allow multiple negative matches. the values will be joined as they are interpolated (with other negative matches or a positive; it just means that the processing won't stop on some particular token) â€“ is this good idea anyway?

== Far future

* named patterns: @gender{m:xx|f:xxx|n:xzc} - such pattern may allow multiple tokens but it breaks the logic unless some marker will be given in configuration like !gender: that would inform engine that exact kind must be present in a pattern
