== Near future

* rewrite docs for switching methods

* add some negative tests (e.g. empty kind, kinds as nils or empty striongs, tokens as empty strings...)

* doco for negative matches and multiple (groups of tokens) matches

* allow aliases in patterns (switched) [aliases loading and replacement during initial read]

* create accessor called options to controll options from frontend [done, requires removal of old methods]

== Far future

* named patterns: @gender{m:xx|f:xxx|n:xzc} - such pattern may allow multiple tokens but it breaks the logic unless some marker will be given in configuration like !gender: that would inform engine that exact kind must be present in a pattern

* use tilde symbols (~) to allow multiple negative matches. the values will be joined as they are interpolated (with other negative matches or a positive; it just means that the processing won't stop on some particular token) â€“ is this good idea anyway?
